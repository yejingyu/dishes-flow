# dishes-flow
Dishes Flow is a order tracking system for restaurants. It helps waiter/waitress, cook, and cashier check the current order and the state of the order. Also, manager can use the statistics to understand the restaurant.

Dishes Flow is written in PHP and SQL. After I have some devices for testing, it would be porting to an Android app.
